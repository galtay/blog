[Simon Willison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Willison) runs a 
[great blog](https://simonwillison.net/){:target="_blank"}, gives 
[great talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1-KQZZarpc){:target="_blank"}, 
and is the kind of 
[netizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen){:target="_blank"}
we should all aspire to be more like.
In his 
[My approach to running a link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/){:target="_blank"}
post (part of his [how I blog](https://simonwillison.net/series/blogging/){:target="_blank"} 
series) he describes how he runs a link blog where he publishes links to things he found on the internet along with some short commentary.

He wants more people to start blogs :) 

> You should start a blog. Having your own little corner of the internet is good for the soul! 

And he wants you to know that you don't need to write a novel to start out

> ... blogging doesn’t have to be about unique insights. The value is in writing frequently and having something to show for it over time—worthwhile even if you don’t attract much of an audience (or any audience at all).

He also goes on to describe how to "add something extra" along with the found link.
This can serve as a personal log of things that are interesting to the link blog author, 
but it can also serve as an introduction to that material for other people on the internet.

He describes a post he made on Bluesky

> I wish people would post more links to interesting things
>
> I feel like Twitter and LinkedIn and Instagram and TikTok have pushed a lot of people out of the habit of doing that, by penalizing shared links in the various “algorithms”
>
> Bluesky doesn’t have that misfeature, thankfully!
>
> (In my ideal world everyone would get their own link blog too, but sharing links on Bluesky and Mastodon is almost as good)

I'll be making these kinds of posts with the [tif] prefix (for "things i've found") and they will have the `tif` tag.
