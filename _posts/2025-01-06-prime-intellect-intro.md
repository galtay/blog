> Prime Intellect democratizes AI development at scale. Our platform makes it easy to find global compute resources and train state-of-the-art models through distributed training across clusters. Collectively own the resulting open AI innovations, from language models to scientific breakthroughs.

This is a cool organization focusing on three main areas,

* **Compute:** aggregates machines from many clouds and offers great prices (e.g. ~$2/hour for H100 80GB).
* **Research:** advancing the state of the art of decentralized training across multiple heterogeneous clusters.
* **Intelligence:** developing and sharing co-owned models trained on this dectralized infrastructure.
