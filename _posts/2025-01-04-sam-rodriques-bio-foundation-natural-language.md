[Sam Rodriques](https://www.sam-rodriques.com/) 
Director and CEO of [FutureHouse](https://www.futurehouse.org/),
a non-profit working on AI agents to automate research in biology and other complex sciences, discusses the need for natural language understanding alongside structured biological foundation models.

> Indeed, I think natural language has an essential role to play in representing biology, and is ultimately unavoidable, insofar as it is the only medium we know of that is sufficiently structured for machine learning and sufficiently flexible to represent the full diversity of biological concepts.
